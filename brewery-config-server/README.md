# Brewery Configuration Server

The configuration server for each microservice. The actual configuration files are pulled from my GitHub 
repository named [brewery-config](https://github.com/strohs/brewery-config)


This server is secured using HTTP Basic Authentication. The user id and password are:
- userid = `MyUserName`
- password = `MySecretPassword`
